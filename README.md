### Does Your Vote Matter?

<br>

Using combinatorix, I created a probability model for the likelihood that a single voter can impact an election. As seen in the graph above, I found and proved that, given that the all the possible ways the other voters can vote are equally likely, the probability that a single voter can impact an election is actually greater than that voter's share of the vote. This assumption may not always hold, but the finding show that an individual's impact on democracy is greater than what some cynics might think.

### Linear Regression in Sklearn versus Statsmodels
<br>

I analyzed the differences between performing sklearn and statsmodels in this [blogpost](https://medium.com/@hsrinivasan2/linear-regression-in-scikit-learn-vs-statsmodels-568b60792991). In the article, I explore the difference beyond the syntax by evaluating the underlying algorithms, efficicency, and models of both classes.
