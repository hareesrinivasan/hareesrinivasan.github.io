### The Evolution of NBA Team's Field Goal Attempts
<br>

The graph above plots every team's average 2-pt and 3-pt field goal attempts per game. The shaded area represents the difference between the maximum and minimum field goal attempts per each year. This data was useful in conducting the following analysis. Note: the year listed represents the second year of the NBA season, so 1985 is the 1984-85 season, while 2020 is the 2019-20 season.

### Predicting NBA Playoff Series Winners
<br>

The purpose of this project was to predict the winners of NBA playoff series given regular season data from that season. A team's score in a given game can be broken down into three categories: 2-pointers, 3-pointers, and free throws. The number of successful baskets in each type can be modeled by a poisson distribution

### Does Your Vote Matter?

<br>

Using combinatorix, I created a probability model for the likelihood that a single voter can impact an election. As seen in the graph above, I found and proved that, given that the all the possible ways the other voters can vote are equally likely, the probability that a single voter can impact an election is actually greater than that voter's share of the vote. This assumption may not always hold, but the finding show that an individual's impact on democracy is greater than what some cynics might think.

### Linear Regression in Sklearn versus Statsmodels

I analyzed the differences between performing sklearn and statsmodels in this [blogpost](https://medium.com/@hsrinivasan2/linear-regression-in-scikit-learn-vs-statsmodels-568b60792991). In the article, I explore the difference beyond the syntax by evaluating the underlying algorithms, efficicency, and models of both classes.
